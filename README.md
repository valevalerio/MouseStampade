# TrisGame

This is intent to be a network multi-thread based game. Tris, also known as, Tic Tac Toe.
It's possibile to play online by typing the ip address and the port on which it is supposed to be the server, that initialize itself in the same manner, with the arguments passed by the command line.
It's a simple project, a little improvement to my skills as network, multt-thread based programming, an help that I've offered to a friend in need for her exam in Computer Science at the engineering university
